# SCA Remediation Gemini CLI Bundle

Plans and applies dependency-vulnerability fixes using Endor SCA findings,
VersionUpgrade and Upgrade Impact Analysis evidence, deterministic risk
decisions, and local validation. It separates low-risk changes from upgrades
requiring deeper compatibility review and requires explicit approval before
editing files, pushing branches, opening change requests, or creating
tickets.

## Start Here

This is the Gemini CLI generated skill and subagent bundle for `sca-remediation`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Prefer the generated Gemini extension under `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit`, then restart Gemini CLI. Then use the example prompt below: Use @sca-remediation to check this repository for P0 SCA findings I can start remediating. Do not edit files or open a PR/MR until I approve. |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `actions.yaml`, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/sca-remediation/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `gemini-3.5-flash`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `host managed`.
- Generated behavior: subagent frontmatter pins model: gemini-3.5-flash.
- Override behavior: explicit subagent definition or host subagent configuration wins.
- Provider guidance: <https://geminicli.com/docs/core/subagents/>.

## Install Through The Generated Extension

Prefer the generated extension package under `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit`.

```bash
gemini extensions install /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit
```

Restart Gemini CLI after installing or updating the extension.

## Manual Fallback

Copy this bundle into a custom Gemini extension or install the skill and
subagent manually under your Gemini configuration.

## Requirements

- Gemini CLI with filesystem and terminal access to the target repository.
- Endor tenant access through authenticated `endorctl agent api --agent-id sca-remediation`.
- Git and source-provider credentials for approved branch, PR/MR, review, or comment workflows.

## Example

```text
Use @sca-remediation to check this repository for P0 SCA findings I can start remediating. Do not edit files or open a PR/MR until I approve.
```

## Example Workflow

```text
Use @sca-remediation to show me the other non-breaking low-risk UIA-backed PRs for this repository. Keep this separate from the P0/exploited queue and risky solver. Do not edit files, create branches, push, or open a PR/MR.
```

```text
Use @sca-remediation to prepare the top UIA-backed dependency remediation for this repository. Show the selected package, affected manifests, VersionUpgrade/UIA UUID, risk, CIA status, risk_decision, findings fixed, folded advisory/finding list, validation command, branch name, PR/MR title, and body before changing files.
```

## Architecture

![SCA Remediation architecture](architecture.svg)

This SCA remediation agent resolves repository context from a matching local checkout or a user-supplied repository selector, queries Endor SCA findings, requires VersionUpgrade/UIA evidence before recommending a best first fix, keeps non-breaking low-risk UIA PR candidates separate from the P0/exploited queue and risky solver, resolves risky or CIA-indeterminate upgrades into a deterministic risk_decision, prepares local dependency changes and validation when a checkout exists, and opens a PR/MR only after explicit approval plus source-provider write access. Without a checkout it returns an evidence-only plan and records the missing source, validation, and delivery capabilities instead of fabricating them. It does not use or require an Endor MCP server.

## Notes

- `SKILL.md` and the subagent markdown are generated from the source recipe and should not be hand-edited in installed copies.
- The plugin package installs the skill under `skills/<agent>/` and the subagent under `agents/<agent>.md`.
- Keep host-specific approval gates intact: local edits, branch pushes, PR/MR creation, PR/MR comments, and Endor policy writes are separate decisions.
- `actions.yaml` records semantic side-effect contracts when the recipe declares mutating actions.
