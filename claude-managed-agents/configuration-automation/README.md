# Configuration Automation

Compares GitHub repository inventory with Endor projects, GitHub App
coverage, monitored branches, scan profiles, package-manager integrations,
dependency resolution, and reachability evidence. It identifies onboarding
and configuration gaps and provides targeted setup instructions without
changing GitHub, Endor, or source repositories.

## Start Here

This is the Claude Managed Agents generated agent for `configuration-automation`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Update generated YAML placeholders, then create the managed agent and environment. Then use the example prompt below: Probe GitHub org <org> for Endor monitored-branch onboarding gaps and setup prescriptions. Keep the workflow read-only. |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/configuration-automation/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `sonnet`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `host default`.
- Generated behavior: recipe sonnet alias compiles to claude-sonnet-4-6.
- Override behavior: managed host configuration remains authoritative.
- Provider guidance: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>.

## Install

Update placeholders in `agent.yaml`, `environment.yaml`, and
`session-template.yaml`, then create the agent and environment in
Claude Managed Agents.

```bash
ant beta:agents create < agent.yaml
ant beta:environments create < environment.yaml
```

Use `session-template.yaml` as the starting point for session creation after
you have the created agent ID, environment ID, and any required vault IDs.

## Requirements

- Anthropic Console or `ant` CLI access to Claude Managed Agents.
- An environment that can install and authenticate endorctl for the read-only API lookups documented in endorctl-setup.md.
- Read-only GitHub.com credentials available to the managed session, or exported GitHub inventory JSON supplied in the prompt.

## Example User Message

```text
Probe GitHub org <org> for Endor monitored-branch onboarding gaps and setup prescriptions. Keep the workflow read-only.
```

## Architecture

![Configuration Automation architecture](architecture.svg)

This read-only agent compares GitHub.com repository inventory with Endor project, GitHub App, monitored-branch scan, package, scan profile, toolchain, and package-manager evidence. It returns onboarding lanes, reason codes, evidence queries, and setup prescriptions, but does not run scans, create profiles, edit repositories, change GitHub settings, or mutate Endor state.

## Notes

- This agent compares GitHub.com repository inventory with Endor project, GitHub App, package, monitored-branch scan, scan profile, toolchain, and package-manager evidence.
- It uses read-only Endor and GitHub lookups to produce onboarding lanes, reason codes, evidence queries, and setup prescriptions.
- The generated environment allows api.endorlabs.com plus GitHub.com/API hosts for read-only inventory. It still must not run scans, clone repositories, create profiles, update package manager integrations, change GitHub settings, open PRs/MRs, or mutate Endor state.
