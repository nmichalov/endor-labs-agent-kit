# Troubleshooting

Diagnoses Endor setup, authentication, integration, scanning,
dependency-resolution, container, reachability, policy, and workflow
problems. It gathers the smallest useful set of read-only evidence needed to
identify the likely root cause and recommend the lowest-friction repair
without modifying Endor, source-provider, or repository state.

## Start Here

This is the Claude Managed Agents generated agent for `troubleshooting`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Update generated YAML placeholders, then create the managed agent and environment. Then use the example prompt below: Diagnose this Endor scan failure from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence. Keep the workflow read-only. |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/troubleshooting/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `sonnet`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `host default`.
- Generated behavior: recipe sonnet alias compiles to claude-sonnet-4-6.
- Override behavior: managed host configuration remains authoritative.
- Provider guidance: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>.

## Install

Update placeholders in `agent.yaml`, `environment.yaml`, and
`session-template.yaml`, then create the agent and environment in
Claude Managed Agents.

```bash
ant beta:agents create < agent.yaml
ant beta:environments create < environment.yaml
```

Use `session-template.yaml` as the starting point for session creation after
you have the created agent ID, environment ID, and any required vault IDs.

## Requirements

- Anthropic Console or `ant` CLI access to Claude Managed Agents.
- An environment that can install and authenticate endorctl for the read-only API lookups documented in endorctl-setup.md.

## Example User Message

```text
Diagnose this Endor scan failure from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence. Keep the workflow read-only.
```

## Architecture

![Troubleshooting architecture](architecture.svg)

This read-only agent diagnoses Endor Labs errors, warnings, scan failures, slow scans, missing integrations, and unhealthy configuration from user-provided issue text plus read-only Endor evidence. It returns a troubleshooting verdict, issue lanes, evidence queries, root-cause hypotheses, low-friction repair guidance, validation steps, and gated future action contracts for anything that would mutate Endor, source-provider, registry, CI, or repository state.

## Notes

- This agent diagnoses Endor Labs errors, warnings, missing integrations, scan failures, slow scans, and unhealthy configuration from user-provided issue text plus read-only Endor evidence.
- It returns a troubleshooting verdict, issue lanes, evidence queries, root-cause hypotheses, low-friction repair guidance, validation steps, and gated future action contracts.
- The generated environment allows api.endorlabs.com for read-only Endor lookups. It still must not run scans, create scan log requests, change credentials, edit scan profiles, update integrations, post comments, open PRs/MRs, or mutate Endor state.
