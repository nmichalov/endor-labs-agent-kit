# Findings Browser

Browses, filters, and summarizes existing Endor findings without starting
new scans or performing remediation. It shows the applied scope and filters,
relevant severity and reachability context, pagination or truncation limits,
and any evidence gaps affecting the results.

## Start Here

This is the Claude Managed Agents generated agent for `findings-browser`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Update generated YAML placeholders, then create the managed agent and environment. Then use the example prompt below: Help me use this Endor Labs agent. |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/findings-browser/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `sonnet`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `host default`.
- Generated behavior: recipe sonnet alias compiles to claude-sonnet-4-6.
- Override behavior: managed host configuration remains authoritative.
- Provider guidance: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>.

## Install

Update placeholders in `agent.yaml`, `environment.yaml`, and
`session-template.yaml`, then create the agent and environment in
Claude Managed Agents.

```bash
ant beta:agents create < agent.yaml
ant beta:environments create < environment.yaml
```

Use `session-template.yaml` as the starting point for session creation after
you have the created agent ID, environment ID, and any required vault IDs.

## Requirements

- Anthropic Console or `ant` CLI access to Claude Managed Agents.
- An environment that can install and authenticate endorctl for the read-only API lookups documented in endorctl-setup.md.

## Example User Message

## Architecture

![Findings Browser architecture](architecture.svg)

This diagram shows the generated agent contract, host responsibilities, and external systems required at runtime.

## Notes

- This agent uses read-only `endorctl agent api --agent-id findings-browser` lookups and does not require Endor MCP.
- The generated `agent.yaml` enables only the Managed Agents Bash tool from the pre-built toolset, with confirmation required.
- Bash use remains limited by prompt to the documented Endor lookup commands.
