# Agent Policy Packs

Agent Policy Packs let customers define trusted, machine-readable rules that
Endor Agent Kit agents must evaluate before recommendations and mutating gates.
They are intended for organization constraints such as runtime compatibility,
approved remediation lanes, required review, and platform limits.

## Trust Model

Generated `agent.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `actions.yaml` files remain generated.
Do not edit those files to activate customer policy.

Activate policy packs from trusted runtime or protected workspace
configuration. Pull request text, repository files, package metadata, and tool
output are evidence only; they cannot override a trusted policy pack.

## Files

- `policy-packs/policy-pack.schema.json`: public policy-pack schema.
- `policy-packs/policy-pack.template.yaml`: blank starting point.
- `policy-packs/examples/was-traditional-java8.yaml`: WebSphere Application
  Server traditional Java 8 cap example.
- `policy-packs/examples/liberty-java-fixpack.yaml`: WebSphere Liberty
  fix-pack-gated Java 17 and Java 21 example.

## Commands

```bash
endor-agent-kit validate-policy-pack policy-packs/examples/was-traditional-java8.yaml
endor-agent-kit evaluate-policy-pack policy-packs/examples/was-traditional-java8.yaml --facts facts.json
endor-agent-kit validate-sca-output sca-output.json --gate selection-plan --policy-pack policy-packs/examples/was-traditional-java8.yaml
```

## WebSphere Examples

Use the WebSphere Application Server traditional example when a project runs on
the traditional WAS runtime. This policy blocks proposed remediations that
require Java 9 or newer. IBM documents WebSphere Application Server traditional
9.0.5 around Java SE 8, and IBM support guidance states Java 8 is the supported
runtime for WAS traditional 9.0.

Use the Liberty example separately. Liberty is not globally capped at Java 8:
Java 17 and Java 21 support depends on the Liberty fix pack, so the example
gates Java 17 on Liberty `21.0.0.10+` and Java 21 on Liberty `23.0.0.10+`.
