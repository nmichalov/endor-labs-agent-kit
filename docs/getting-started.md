# Getting Started

Use this guide when you want to install and run Endor Labs Agent Kit workflows.
If you are changing agent behavior or publishing the public distribution mirror,
use `docs/maintainer-guide.md` or `docs/distribution-sync.md` instead.

## Pick A Host

| Host | Start Here | Good Fit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `plugins/claude/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md` | Plugin install with Claude Code agents and setup skill. |
| Codex CLI/custom agents | `plugins/codex/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md` | Plugin install with one setup skill plus approval-gated managed custom-agent TOML files. |
| Codex Plugins Directory | `plugins/codex-directory/endor-labs-agent-kit/` | Reviewed skills-only install with 11 workflows, setup, and the customer's active Codex model. |
| Gemini CLI | `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md` | Gemini extension install with skills and preview subagents. |
| Antigravity CLI | `plugins/antigravity/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md` | Antigravity plugin install with skills and subagents. |
| Cursor | `/add-plugin endorlabs` | Public Cursor plugin with generated workflow agents, support skills, advisory hooks, and MCP metadata. |
| Cursor SDK | `cursor-sdk/README.md` | Python SDK automation for local workspaces, CI, orchestration, backend services, or Cursor cloud agents. |
| Manual single-agent install | `<host>/<agent>/README.md` | One workflow in one host without the full plugin package. |
| Runtime-neutral integration | `portable/<agent>/README.md` | Internal runtime with its own adapters, approvals, audit, and credentials. |

The public distribution repo is `endorlabs/ai-plugins`. This source repo owns
recipes, generation, tests, and guardrails.

Google documents Antigravity CLI as the consumer transition path for Gemini
CLI. Use the Gemini package for supported Gemini CLI environments and
compatibility checks; use the Antigravity package for affected Gemini CLI
consumer accounts.

## Install A Plugin

Claude Code public install for new users:

```text
/plugin marketplace add endorlabs/ai-plugins
/plugin install endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs
/reload-plugins
/agents
```

The same package is also available from Anthropic's pre-registered official
marketplace under its stable technical id. It is displayed as **Endor Labs
Agent Kit**:

```text
/plugin install ai-plugins@claude-plugins-official
/reload-plugins
/agents
```

Existing Claude Code users pinned to the historical id can keep using:

```text
/plugin marketplace add endorlabs/ai-plugins
/plugin install ai-plugins@endorlabs
```

Choose one Claude distribution path. Do not enable
`endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs`, `ai-plugins@endorlabs`, and
`ai-plugins@claude-plugins-official` together in the same profile for normal
use. They expose the same setup skill and agents.

For a local checkout, add the repository marketplace with `/plugin marketplace
add ./` and install `endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs`. For one-off development,
use `claude --plugin-dir plugins/claude/endor-labs-agent-kit`. Do not use
`claude --plugin-dir .` from the Agent Kit source repository: its root manifest
is a guard around Cursor artifacts. The generated `ai-plugins` mirror is
different because synchronization installs the canonical Claude agents,
setup-only skills, and Claude hooks at that mirror root. The same sync creates
a self-contained Cursor package under
`plugins/cursor/endor-labs-agent-kit/` and points the Cursor marketplace at it,
so neither host auto-discovers the other host's components.

For Codex, install the public package with this instruction:

```text
Use /plugins to find and install Endor Labs Agent Kit from the public Codex Plugins Directory.
```

Cursor public installation is `/add-plugin endorlabs`. Antigravity installs the
complete package from the immutable `2.2.1` release tag:

```bash
git clone --branch 2.2.1 https://github.com/endorlabs/ai-plugins.git endor-ai-plugins-2.2.1
agy plugin validate ./endor-ai-plugins-2.2.1/plugins/antigravity/endor-labs-agent-kit
agy plugin install ./endor-ai-plugins-2.2.1/plugins/antigravity/endor-labs-agent-kit
```

For Gemini CLI and other maintainer installation paths, use the host package
README because commands depend on the pushed tag and host-specific marketplace
behavior. In this source repo, Cursor IDE
uses `.cursor-plugin/`, root `agents/`, root `skills/`, root advisory `hooks/`,
and `assets/logo.png`; the public mirror marketplace points to the complete
`plugins/cursor/endor-labs-agent-kit/` package. Cursor SDK automation uses
`cursor-sdk/`; Gemini uses
`plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/`.

Codex plugin installation exposes only the setup skill. Before the first Codex
workflow, ask it:

```text
Use the endor-agent-kit-setup skill to install only the bundled Codex custom agents. I approve the managed agents-only installation.
```

Start a fresh Codex task after that installation so the 11 workflow agents and
the setup agent are discovered. Workflow-skill fallbacks remain opt-in.

The public-directory artifact is a separate route. It exposes the 11 workflow
skills and setup directly, does not install custom-agent TOML files, declare a
hosted MCP server, implement plugin OAuth, or pin a model. Its workflows use the
customer's local authenticated `endorctl` session. Installing it must not replace
or rewrite the CLI/custom-agent package.
For a runner or container using the CLI package, set `CODEX_HOME` explicitly to
a persistent writable directory before running the bundled installer; do not
rely on a developer workstation's home directory.

## Run Cursor SDK Automation

Use the SDK lane when the workflow should be launched from Python code instead
of installed into the Cursor IDE.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r cursor-sdk/requirements.txt
export CURSOR_API_KEY="crsr_..."
python cursor-sdk/run_cursor_agent.py endor-configuration-automation-agent \
  --workspace /path/to/repo \
  "Explain what evidence you need to assess GitHub onboarding gaps. Keep it read-only."
```

For Cursor cloud agents:

```bash
python cursor-sdk/run_cursor_agent.py endor-sca-remediation-agent \
  --mode cloud \
  --repo-url https://github.com/your-org/your-repo \
  --ref main \
  "Prepare a remediation plan only. Do not edit files or open a PR."
```

## Run Setup First

After installing a plugin, ask the host to run the setup skill:

```text
Use the endor-agent-kit-setup skill to check Endor Agent Kit readiness.
```

Setup is readiness guidance. It can report missing `endorctl`, `gh`, namespace,
auth, MCP, or toolchain prerequisites. It must not run scans, run
`endorctl host-check`, edit shell profiles, install language runtimes, install
package managers, or write credentials.

For Codex, setup also owns the separately approved managed custom-agent
installation described above; plugin installation alone does not write to the
user's custom-agent directory.

## Choose A Workflow

| Job | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Triage Endor AI SAST findings | `ai-sast-remediation` |
| Assess CI/CD and supply chain posture | `cicd-posture` |
| Diagnose Endor setup, scan, auth, policy, or integration issues | `troubleshooting` |
| Browse, filter, and summarize existing Endor findings | `findings-browser` |
| Correlate supply-chain malware intelligence against tenant inventory | `malware-responder` |
| Probe GitHub onboarding and monitored-branch coverage gaps | `configuration-automation` |
| Find safe dependency remediation paths with Endor SCA evidence | `sca-remediation` |
| Compare package risk, make a dependency decision, or review repository dependencies | `dependency-reviewer` with the `package-risk`, `package-decision`, or `repository-review` profile |
| Preview remediation options without making changes | `remediation-planning` |
| Analyze upgrade impact or explain vulnerabilities | `oss-upgrade-investigator`, `vulnerability-explainer` |

Each workflow above is generated for the supported host packages. Use the
selected host README for exact invocation names and install paths.

## First Prompts

```text
Use the ai-sast-remediation skill to triage AI SAST findings for this repository. Do not edit files, open a PR/MR, or create an Endor policy unless I approve the specific gate.
```

```text
Use the sca-remediation skill to check this repository for P0 SCA findings I can start remediating. Do not edit files or open a PR/MR until I approve.
```

```text
Use the configuration-automation skill to probe GitHub org <org> for Endor monitored-branch onboarding gaps and setup prescriptions. Keep the workflow read-only.
```

```text
Use the troubleshooting skill to diagnose this Endor issue from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence. Keep the workflow read-only.
```

```text
Use the cicd-posture skill to assess CI/CD and supply chain posture for namespace <namespace>. Keep it read-only and validate the deterministic score.
```

```text
Use the findings-browser skill to show the critical and high reachable findings for namespace <namespace>. Keep it read-only.
```

## Safety Expectations

- Setup and read-only workflows must not mutate Endor, source providers, package managers, or repositories.
- Mutating workflows split file edits, branch pushes, PR/MR creation, PR/MR comments, tickets, approval verification, and Endor policy writes into separate approval gates.
- Agents must report unavailable evidence in `data_gaps` instead of inventing facts.
- Secret values must never be printed, persisted, copied into prompts, or written into generated artifacts.
