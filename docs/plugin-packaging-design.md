# Plugin Packaging Design

This is a blast-radius note for adding an Endor Labs Agent Kit plugin route.
The Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Antigravity, Cursor, and Cursor SDK package
slices are implemented behind `--include-plugins`.

## Current Decision

Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini support still publish generated artifacts under
`claude-code/<agent>/`, `codex/<agent>/`, and `gemini/<agent>/`. The plugin
package slices now wrap host-compatible public workflows under:

- `plugins/codex/endor-labs-agent-kit/`
- `plugins/codex-directory/endor-labs-agent-kit/` for official Codex directory submission
- `plugins/claude/endor-labs-agent-kit/`
- `plugins/claude/ai-plugins/` for legacy Claude Code compatibility
- `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/`
- `plugins/antigravity/endor-labs-agent-kit/`
- `.cursor-plugin/` plus root generated `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, and
  `assets/logo.png` for Cursor
- `cursor-sdk/` for Cursor Python SDK automation

The plugin route should sit alongside generated host artifacts. It should not
replace `.claude/agents/` installs, Claude Managed Agents YAML, or Codex skill
installs until the target plugin host has a stable installation, permission, and
metadata contract.

## Implemented Codex Plugin Shape

The generated Codex plugin package includes:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` for plugin metadata.
- `skills/<agent>/SKILL.md` rendered from the same source recipe body as the
  generated Codex skill artifact.
- `skills/endor-agent-kit-setup/SKILL.md` rendered from
  `source/plugin-support/setup/setup.md`.
- `agents/endor-*-agent.toml` custom-agent files generated from the same recipe
  body, with provenance comments and read-only sandbox hints only for read-only
  workflows.
- `scripts/install_codex_agents.py` for provenance-gated global install, update,
  status, and uninstall of bundled Codex custom agents.
- `assets/logo.png`, with the official Endor green (`#26D07C`) used for the
  manifest brand color.
- Public repository marketplace metadata at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
- Package-local marketplace metadata at
  `plugins/codex/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` for local validation.

Do not add MCP servers to the plugin manifest by default. `sca-remediation` and
`ai-sast-remediation` are `endorctl_agent_api` workflows, and their safety contract depends
on local terminal/source-provider state plus explicit approval gates.

## Codex Distribution Channels

Codex has two generated packages with the same canonical workflow identities
and different distribution channels:

- `repository`: `plugins/codex/endor-labs-agent-kit/` remains the CLI,
  container, runner, setup, installer, and custom-agent package.
- `official-directory`: `plugins/codex-directory/endor-labs-agent-kit/` is a
  skills-only public submission package with 11 workflow skills plus one setup
  skill.

`CatalogPluginPackage.distribution_channel` defaults to `repository` for old
manifests. Package identity is `(host, name, distribution_channel)`, and
publisher replacement occurs by `(host, distribution_channel)`, so a partial
publication cannot erase the sibling Codex package. Installation checks select
only the repository channel.

The directory package has one `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, the full square PNG
logo, and a separate compact `assets/composer-icon.png` derived from the
official Endor symbol artwork. Both Codex manifests use the official Endor
green (`#26D07C`) for `interface.brandColor`; the directory manifest references
the compact PNG through `interface.composerIcon`. The package's
`skills/<canonical-id>/` directories contain only `SKILL.md`,
`agents/openai.yaml`, and the skill-local artifact summarizer. The separate
`skills/endor-agent-kit-setup/` directory contains only `SKILL.md` and
`agents/openai.yaml`; it checks the customer's local `endorctl`, namespace, and
authentication readiness without implementing plugin OAuth. The package has no
custom-agent TOML, installer, hooks, MCP/apps, bundled credentials, staging
values, or model pin. The public skills use the customer's active Codex model.
Large-result instructions resolve the helper from the active `SKILL.md` path
rather than the working directory.

Full publication requires the exact canonical 11-recipe set. A strict subset
skips this package and preserves its directory and manifest record; unexpected
or duplicate Codex recipe IDs fail closed.

The signed catalog projects install options from complete
`CatalogPluginPackage` records rather than requiring one compiler record per
provider and agent. A public package is eligible only when it includes all
published canonical agent IDs and the setup skill artifact. This lets the
monolithic Cursor and Antigravity packages appear alongside Claude Code and the
Codex official-directory package without duplicate compilers. Each provider's
full-package command is identical across all 11 agent records.

## Implemented Claude Code Plugin Shape

The generated Claude Code plugin packages include:

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for plugin metadata.
- Exactly 11 canonical `agents/<agent>.md` workflow files generated from the
  existing Claude Code artifacts.
- `skills/endor-agent-kit-setup/SKILL.md` rendered from
  `source/plugin-support/setup/setup.md`.
- `hooks/hooks.json` plus fail-open advisory hook scripts in the primary
  `endor-labs-agent-kit` package only. These hooks add Claude context for
  prompt routing, dependency installs, and dependency manifest edits; they do
  not block work, call Endor, use the network, run scans, or write files.
- `assets/logo.png`.
- Public-repo marketplace metadata at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- Package-local marketplace metadata at
  `plugins/claude/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for local validation.

The preferred package id is `endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs`. The legacy
`ai-plugins@endorlabs` package is retained as a real generated package so
existing Claude Code users pinned to that id can continue to install and update
without a breaking rename. Both packages expose the same setup skill and agents;
normal users should not enable both ids in the same Claude profile. The legacy
package intentionally does not include hooks.

Claude task-profile projections are an execution optimization, not additional
customer-facing workflows. They remain generated under `claude-code/<agent>/`
for advanced manual invocation, but neither public Claude package copies them
into `agents/`. The canonical marketplace agent selects and enforces the same
bounded profile contracts internally.

Claude Code plugin-shipped agents do not support `mcpServers`,
`permissionMode`, or `hooks` in agent frontmatter. The generated package strips
those unsupported fields from packaged agents and makes MCP setup explicit in
the setup skill and agent setup note. It does not add plugin-wide MCP by
default.

## Implemented Gemini CLI Extension Shape

The generated Gemini CLI extension package includes:

- `gemini-extension.json` for extension metadata.
- `GEMINI.md` for minimal package context.
- `skills/<agent>/SKILL.md` rendered from the same source recipe body as the
  generated Gemini skill artifact.
- `skills/endor-agent-kit-setup/SKILL.md` rendered from
  `source/plugin-support/setup/setup.md`.
- `agents/<agent>.md` preview subagents generated from the same recipe body,
  with provenance comments and Gemini host-contract text.
- `assets/logo.png`.

Gemini packages do not declare plugin-wide MCP by default. Setup documents that
local installs may show a folder trust prompt and requires a restart after
extension installation or update. Gemini CLI installs a local
extension directory; public distribution clones the tagged GitHub repository
and installs `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/` rather than installing the
multi-host repository root. The package does not generate or publish a zip
artifact.

The repository root MCP support surface is separate from the generated Gemini
package. Root `.mcp.json` may include the source-approved `endor-cli-tools` MCP
server metadata so users can opt into MCP setup, and root `GEMINI.md` can point
agents at the correct package. The repository root must not generate
`gemini-extension.json`: Gemini discovers bundled skills from the installed
extension root's `skills/` directory, while the repository root `skills/`
directory is the Cursor package surface. Generated Gemini package metadata under
`plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/` remains MCP-free unless provider
validation explicitly changes that package contract.

## Implemented Antigravity CLI Plugin Shape

The generated Antigravity CLI plugin package includes:

- `plugin.json` for plugin metadata.
- `skills/<agent>/SKILL.md` rendered from the Gemini-compatible source recipe
  body with Antigravity host-contract text.
- `skills/endor-agent-kit-setup/SKILL.md` rendered from
  `source/plugin-support/setup/setup.md`.
- `agents/<agent>.md` subagents generated from the same recipe body, with
  provenance comments and Antigravity host-contract text.
- `assets/logo.png`.

Antigravity packages do not declare plugin-wide MCP by default. The setup skill
keeps `agy plugin validate`, installation, update, enable/disable, and
uninstall steps explicit and evidence-backed. Antigravity package contents are
derived from the Gemini-compatible recipe set because Google's
transition guidance says Gemini extensions become Antigravity plugins while
retaining skills and subagents.

## Implemented Cursor Package Shape

The source-validation Cursor package includes:

- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` for Cursor package metadata.
- `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` for public marketplace metadata.
- `agents/<agent>.md` rendered from the source recipe body with Cursor
  plugin-agent frontmatter and host-contract text.
- `agents/endor-agent-kit-setup-agent.md` rendered from
  `source/plugin-support/setup/setup.md`.
- `skills/<agent>/SKILL.md` rendered from the source recipe body with Cursor
  host-contract text and support material.
- `skills/<agent>/architecture.svg` copied from the source agent diagram when
  present.
- `skills/<agent>/actions.yaml` when the source recipe declares action
  contracts.
- `skills/endor-agent-kit-setup/SKILL.md` rendered from
  `source/plugin-support/setup/setup.md`.
- `hooks/hooks.json` plus fail-open advisory hook scripts.
- `.mcp.json` with the source-approved optional MCP server declaration.
- `assets/logo.png`.

The Cursor plugin manifest keeps website provenance in its top-level
`homepage` and `repository` fields. Its `author` object contains only the
schema-supported `name` and `email` fields; Cursor's current schema rejects an
additional author URL.

Cursor is intentionally not a Gemini wrapper. Its installable package does not
depend on Gemini metadata; the Gemini CLI extension files live under
`plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/`. The repository root `GEMINI.md` is
support context only, not an installable Gemini extension manifest.

The Agent Kit source checkout keeps those Cursor components at root for source
guardrails. During `ai-plugins` synchronization, the full Cursor payload is
copied to `plugins/cursor/endor-labs-agent-kit/`. Its conventional package
layout contains `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`,
`mcp.json`, and `assets/`. Root `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json` keeps the
stable `endorlabs` id and points to that nested package; the mirror removes the
root Cursor plugin manifest. This mirror-only boundary lets the official Claude
package safely reserve conventional root `agents/`, `skills/`, and `hooks/`
without changing Cursor's payload.

## Implemented Cursor SDK Automation Shape

The generated Cursor SDK automation package includes:

- `cursor-sdk/README.md` for local and cloud run instructions.
- `cursor-sdk/requirements.txt` with the `cursor-sdk` Python dependency.
- `cursor-sdk/agent_definitions.json` as the machine-readable agent map.
- `cursor-sdk/run_cursor_agent.py` as the runnable Python launcher.
- `cursor-sdk/agents/<agent>.md` generated from the same recipe body with
  Cursor SDK host-contract text.
- `cursor-sdk/agents/<agent>.architecture.svg` when the source recipe has an
  architecture diagram.
- `cursor-sdk/agents/<agent>.actions.yaml` when the source recipe declares
  action contracts.

Cursor SDK automation is a separate lane from Cursor plugin delivery. Use it
for CI, orchestration, backend services, scripted local runs, or Cursor cloud
agents. Use the self-contained Cursor plugin package for customer-facing Cursor
IDE UX. The SDK package is still generated from Agent
Kit source recipes and mirrored into `ai-plugins` as a distribution artifact.

## Blast Radius

First-class plugin publishing touches:

- `src/endor_agent_kit/publisher.py` and `src/endor_agent_kit/publication/`
  for generated plugin directories, manifest records, pruning, README rows, and
  artifact checksums.
- `manifest.json` schema expectations, because a plugin package is not the same
  shape as an edition or a single skill artifact. Plugin packages are recorded
  in the separate `plugin_packages` section.
- Tests for publisher output, guardrails, provenance, installer behavior, and
  generated metadata.

The Gemini package follows the same source-first publication model rather than
introducing hand-assembled packages. Gemini local validation installs from
`plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit`; public validation clones the tagged
GitHub repository and installs that generated extension directory.

The Antigravity package also follows the source-first publication model. It
installs from `plugins/antigravity/endor-labs-agent-kit` with `plugin.json` at
the package root; no release archive is generated for either target.

The Cursor package follows the same source-first publication model. The Agent
Kit checkout remains root-shaped for generation and source tests; mirror sync
materializes the official self-contained package at
`plugins/cursor/endor-labs-agent-kit/`. Generation updates managed workflow
agents, managed workflow skill directories, and advisory hooks, while
preserving unrelated source-root skills such as
`skills/create-endor-labs-agent/` and excluding them from the public Cursor
package.

The Cursor SDK package follows the same source-first publication model under
`cursor-sdk/`. It does not install anything into the Cursor IDE; it launches
Cursor's Python SDK with generated Agent Kit prompts and an explicit user task.

## Safety Requirements

Plugin packaging must preserve the same generated skill text and action
metadata. A plugin installer must not silently grant broader permissions than
the recipe declares.

For mutating agents, file edits, branch pushes, PR/MR creation, PR/MR comments,
approval verification, and Endor policy writes must remain separate gates. A
plugin can improve installation and discovery, but it must not flatten those
gates into a single broad authorization.

## Release Validation Status

The release gate is now `docs/plugin-release-checklist.md`. Keep this design
note focused on package shape and blast radius.

Validated locally:

- Codex local marketplace installation from `plugins/codex`.
- Codex repo-root marketplace metadata at `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
- Codex custom-agent installer status/install flow with a temporary
  `CODEX_HOME`.
- Gemini extension package install from the generated local extension
  directory.
- Gemini package structure with `gemini-extension.json` at the extension root
  and no zip artifact.
- Antigravity plugin package validation with `agy plugin validate`.
- Cursor metadata JSON validation and root skill validation.
- Cursor SDK `agent_definitions.json` validation and launcher `py_compile`.

Still release-critical:

- Claude Code package validation with `claude plugin validate`, local
  marketplace install, and fresh-session agent/skill visibility when the
  `claude` CLI is available.
- Codex public GitHub sparse marketplace validation after the repo is public,
  pushed, and tagged.
- Gemini public GitHub install after the repo is public, pushed, and tagged.
- Antigravity install/list/uninstall validation after the package is generated
  and the installed CLI version is available.
- Cursor public package install validation after the repo is public, pushed,
  and tagged.
- Cursor SDK local or cloud smoke validation after API-key use, target repo,
  namespace provenance, and side-effect boundaries are explicitly approved.

## Prototype Result - 2026-05-24

The first prototype package used this local marketplace shape:

- `marketplace.json`
- `plugins/endor-agent-kit-security-agents/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `plugins/endor-agent-kit-security-agents/skills/ai-sast-remediation/`
- `plugins/endor-agent-kit-security-agents/skills/sca-remediation/`

The package copied the generated Codex skill directories byte-for-byte from
`codex/ai-sast-remediation/` and `codex/sca-remediation/`, including each
`SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `actions.yaml`, `architecture.svg`, and
`endorctl-setup.md`.

Validation covered:

- plugin manifest JSON parsing and required metadata fields.
- marketplace path resolution to the local plugin directory.
- Codex skill YAML frontmatter parsing for both packaged skills.
- recursive directory diffs against the generated catalog skill directories.
- absence of plugin-level MCP or app declarations.

Previously unproven and still requiring release validation:

- Codex UI installation from the local marketplace deeplink.
- skill discovery and invocation after plugin installation in a fresh thread.
- bundled custom-agent visibility after setup installs TOML files into
  `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/agents`.

Do not promote this from opt-in `--include-plugins` to default publication until
the unproven host behavior is validated in Codex without weakening the existing
approval gates.
