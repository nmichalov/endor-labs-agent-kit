# Runtime Setup

The SCA Remediation agent preserves a mutating workflow.
Use an authenticated Endor tenant for evidence gathering. A local target
checkout and source-provider adapter credentials are separate capabilities required
before allowing patch or change-request steps.

Required endorctl version: `>=1.7.1088`

## Namespace Guardrails

Preserve normal environment-variable auth and namespace selection:
`ENDOR_NAMESPACE` and `ENDOR_API_CREDENTIALS_*` are supported inputs. Do not
allow silent namespace conflicts.

Read only the current process `ENDOR_NAMESPACE` and the `ENDOR_NAMESPACE` key
from the default `~/.endorctl/config.yaml`. Do not read, cat, source, recurse
through, or point `ENDORCTL_CONFIG` or `--config-path` at tenant-specific,
customer-specific, production, backup, or other non-default Endor config
directories.

If the process environment and default config namespaces both exist and differ,
surface both values with provenance and stop before scoped Endor lookups or
Endor MCP calls. Ask the user which namespace to use for this workflow.

After a namespace is selected, every scoped `endorctl agent api --agent-id sca-remediation` lookup must pass it
explicitly with `-n <namespace>` or `--namespace <namespace>`. Do not rely on
bare `endorctl` namespace resolution.

Capability preflight: `endorctl agent api --help` must succeed.
Fail closed with a setup data gap if the command is unavailable; never
fall back to the unattributed legacy API command.

The recipe documents these Endor lookup groups:

- `resolve_project_from_repository`
- `list_sca_findings`
- `list_version_upgrade_recommendations`
- `get_version_upgrade_details`
- `get_finding_fixing_upgrades`
- `inspect_dependency_metadata`

The agent may also use repository and source-provider adapters
when the user asks it to apply patches, open a PR/MR, verify AppSec
approval evidence, or post PR/MR comments. Confirm the target repository,
base branch, generated diff, and change-request body before allowing
those mutations.

For SCA remediation, the agent must surface VersionUpgrade/UIA evidence
before recommending a best first fix and must get separate confirmation
before local file edits and before branch push or PR/MR creation.
