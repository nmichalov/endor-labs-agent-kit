# AI SAST Remediation Codex Skill

Triages Endor AI SAST findings using exploit-reproduction evidence,
data-flow context, and remediation guidance to distinguish actionable
vulnerabilities from noise. It can prepare targeted code fixes and, after
explicit approval, edit files and open change requests. For exception
workflows, it can create or update scoped Endor exception policies only
after verified AppSec approval and explicit user confirmation.

## Start Here

This is the Codex generated skill for `ai-sast-remediation`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Copy this generated skill directory into `$HOME/.agents/skills/` and start a new Codex session. Then use the example prompt below: Use the ai-sast-remediation skill to triage AI SAST findings for this repository. Do not edit files, open a PR/MR, or create an Endor policy unless I approve the specific gate. |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `actions.yaml`, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/ai-sast-remediation/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `high`.
- Generated behavior: custom-agent TOML pins gpt-5.6-luna and tier-specific reasoning effort.
- Override behavior: explicit Codex model and reasoning settings win.
- Provider guidance: <https://developers.openai.com/codex/subagents>.

## Install

Copy this generated skill directory into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/ai-sast-remediation \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/ai-sast-remediation"
```

Start a new Codex session after installing or replacing the skill.

## Requirements

- Codex with filesystem and terminal access to the target repository.
- Endor tenant access through authenticated `endorctl agent api --agent-id ai-sast-remediation`.
- Git and source-provider credentials for approved branch, PR/MR, review, or comment workflows.
- A configured AppSec approver list before standalone exception-policy creation.
- Endor policy-write access only after verified AppSec approval and explicit user confirmation.

## Example

```text
Use the ai-sast-remediation skill to triage AI SAST findings for this repository. Do not edit files, open a PR/MR, or create an Endor policy unless I approve the specific gate.
```

## Example Workflow

```text
Use the ai-sast-remediation skill to triage AI SAST findings for this repository. Do not edit files, open a PR/MR, or create an Endor policy. Show confirmed true positives, likely false positives, inconclusive findings, exploit-driven priority, remediation-guidance usage, and data gaps.
```

```text
Use the ai-sast-remediation skill to remediate finding <finding_uuid> for this repository. Use Endor Exploit Reproduction and Remediation Guidance as context, but verify the fix against the source. Show me the patch, branch name, PR/MR title, and PR/MR body before pushing. After I approve, open exactly one PR/MR.
```

Use the exception workflow only when a finding should be excepted instead
of remediated in code.

```text
Use the ai-sast-remediation skill to verify AppSec approval on PR/MR <pr_or_mr_url> for finding <finding_uuid>. Allowed AppSec approvers: @alice, @bob. If approval is valid and not self-approval, check for an existing active Endor exception policy for this finding/project/reason, then render the Endor exception policy spec for my confirmation. After I confirm, create or reuse the scoped policy and comment on the PR/MR with the policy name, policy UUID, Endor project, approver, expiration, and evidence URL.
```

## QA Smoke Test

Use a fresh Codex session after installing the skill. Run a planning-only
prompt first and verify the response references the Codex skill, preserves
approval gates, and does not claim file edits, PR/MR creation, comments, or
Endor policy writes.

## Architecture

![AI SAST Remediation architecture](architecture.svg)

In Agent Kit, PR/MR creation is host-mediated. Codex runs in the target checkout, gathers Endor evidence including exploit reproduction and remediation guidance when present, applies the confirmed diff locally, creates and pushes a branch, then opens the change request with configured source-provider credentials. If the host cannot perform one of those steps, the agent must stop and report the missing capability in `data_gaps`.

## Notes

- `SKILL.md` is generated from the source recipe and should not be hand-edited in installed copies.
- `actions.yaml` records semantic side-effect contracts when the recipe declares mutating actions.
- Keep host-specific approval gates intact: local edits, branch pushes, PR/MR creation, PR/MR comments, and Endor policy writes are separate decisions.
