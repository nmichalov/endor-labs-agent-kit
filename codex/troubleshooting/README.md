# Troubleshooting Codex Skill

Diagnoses Endor setup, authentication, integration, scanning,
dependency-resolution, container, reachability, policy, and workflow
problems. It gathers the smallest useful set of read-only evidence needed to
identify the likely root cause and recommend the lowest-friction repair
without modifying Endor, source-provider, or repository state.

## Start Here

This is the Codex generated skill for `troubleshooting`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Copy this generated skill directory into `$HOME/.agents/skills/` and start a new Codex session. Then use the example prompt below: Use the troubleshooting skill to diagnose this Endor issue from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence. Keep the workflow read-only. |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/troubleshooting/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `gpt-5.6-luna`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `medium`.
- Generated behavior: custom-agent TOML pins gpt-5.6-luna and tier-specific reasoning effort.
- Override behavior: explicit Codex model and reasoning settings win.
- Provider guidance: <https://developers.openai.com/codex/subagents>.

## Install

Copy this generated skill directory into your Codex skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/troubleshooting \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/troubleshooting"
```

Start a new Codex session after installing or replacing the skill.

## Requirements

- Codex with access to the current workspace.
- The Endor access path declared by the recipe.
- No mutating repository, source-provider, or Endor writes for this skill.

## Example

```text
Use the troubleshooting skill to diagnose this Endor issue from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence. Keep the workflow read-only.
```

## Example Workflow

```text
Use the troubleshooting skill to diagnose this Endor scan failure. Namespace: <namespace>. Project: <project>. Error: <redacted error text>. Keep the workflow read-only and tell me the lowest-friction fix.
```

```text
Use the troubleshooting skill to troubleshoot slow PR scans in a large monorepo. Check whether incremental PR scans, baselines, scan profile settings, or workflow configuration would improve performance. Do not change the profile or rerun scans.
```

```text
Use the troubleshooting skill to diagnose why users cannot log in through SSO for namespace <namespace>. Inspect read-only identity provider evidence and do not print secrets.
```

## QA Smoke Test

Use a fresh Codex session after installing the skill. Run a planning-only
prompt first and verify the response references the Codex skill, preserves
approval gates, and does not claim file edits, PR/MR creation, comments, or
Endor policy writes.

## Architecture

![Troubleshooting architecture](architecture.svg)

This read-only agent diagnoses Endor Labs errors, warnings, scan failures, slow scans, missing integrations, and unhealthy configuration from user-provided issue text plus read-only Endor evidence. It returns a troubleshooting verdict, issue lanes, evidence queries, root-cause hypotheses, low-friction repair guidance, validation steps, and gated future action contracts for anything that would mutate Endor, source-provider, registry, CI, or repository state.

## Notes

- `SKILL.md` is generated from the source recipe and should not be hand-edited in installed copies.
- This read-only skill does not include `actions.yaml`; future mutating workflows must declare explicit action contracts before publication.
- Keep host-specific approval gates intact: local edits, branch pushes, PR/MR creation, PR/MR comments, and Endor policy writes are separate decisions.
