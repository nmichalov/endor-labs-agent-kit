# Troubleshooting

Diagnoses Endor setup, authentication, integration, scanning,
dependency-resolution, container, reachability, policy, and workflow
problems. It gathers the smallest useful set of read-only evidence needed to
identify the likely root cause and recommend the lowest-friction repair
without modifying Endor, source-provider, or repository state.

## Start Here

This is the Claude Code generated agent for `troubleshooting`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Copy the generated subagent into `.claude/agents/` and restart Claude Code if needed. Then use the example prompt below: @agent-troubleshooting diagnose this Endor scan failure from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/troubleshooting/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `sonnet`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `host default`.
- Generated behavior: agent frontmatter defaults to sonnet.
- Override behavior: Claude environment or per-invocation subagent override wins.
- Provider guidance: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>.

## Install

Copy `troubleshooting.md` into your target repository's `.claude/agents/` directory,
then restart Claude Code if needed.

## Requirements

- Claude Code with the generated subagent file installed.
- Authenticated endorctl for the read-only API lookups documented in endorctl-setup.md.

## Setup Checklist

### 1. Install The Subagent

Run this from the workspace where Claude Code will perform the
read-only Endor troubleshooting:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/claude-code/troubleshooting/troubleshooting.md \
  .claude/agents/troubleshooting.md
```

### 2. Verify Read-Only Endor Access

```bash
endorctl --version
```

Troubleshooting does not need an Endor MCP server. It uses only
documented read-only `endorctl agent api --agent-id troubleshooting` lookups and user-provided redacted
error text. If Endor access, project selectors, scan evidence, workflow
evidence, or integration evidence are unavailable, the agent should report
the missing setup in `data_gaps`.

### 3. Keep Troubleshooting Read-Only

The agent may inspect scan, workflow, integration, package manager, SSO,
policy, finding, reachability, and container evidence through read-only
Endor lookups. It should not run scans, create scan log requests, change
credentials, edit scan profiles, update integrations, post comments, open
PRs/MRs, or mutate Endor state.

## Example

```text
@agent-troubleshooting diagnose this Endor scan failure from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence
```

## Example Workflow

Use these copy/paste prompts after the agent is installed.

```text
@agent-troubleshooting diagnose this Endor scan failure. Namespace: <namespace>. Project: <project>. Error: <redacted error text>. Keep the workflow read-only and tell me the lowest-friction fix.
```

```text
@agent-troubleshooting our PR scans take too long in a large monorepo. Check whether incremental PR scans, baselines, scan profile settings, or workflow configuration would improve performance. Do not change the profile or rerun scans.
```

```text
@agent-troubleshooting users cannot log in through SSO for namespace <namespace>. Inspect read-only identity provider evidence and tell me what to verify without printing secrets.
```

The result should explain the likely cause, cite the evidence gathered,
rank repair steps by friction, and place any scan rerun, profile edit,
integration update, credential change, comment, or support-ticket step
in `future_action_contracts`.

## QA Smoke Test

When validating this agent, isolate the run from user-level Claude skills so
the result proves the Agent Kit artifact itself is doing the work.

```bash
export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
claude -p --agent troubleshooting \
  "Diagnose this Endor issue from redacted text only: endorctl scan exited with code 13 because dependencies were not downloaded. Keep it read-only."
```

The run log should not reference user-level skills or Endor MCP tooling,
and it should not claim scan reruns, configuration changes, comments,
branches, PRs/MRs, or Endor writes.

## Architecture

![Troubleshooting architecture](architecture.svg)

This read-only agent diagnoses Endor Labs errors, warnings, scan failures, slow scans, missing integrations, and unhealthy configuration from user-provided issue text plus read-only Endor evidence. It returns a troubleshooting verdict, issue lanes, evidence queries, root-cause hypotheses, low-friction repair guidance, validation steps, and gated future action contracts for anything that would mutate Endor, source-provider, registry, CI, or repository state.

## Notes

- This agent diagnoses Endor Labs errors, warnings, missing integrations, scan failures, slow scans, and unhealthy configuration from user-provided issue text plus read-only Endor evidence.
- It returns a troubleshooting verdict, issue lanes, evidence queries, root-cause hypotheses, low-friction repair guidance, validation steps, and gated future action contracts.
- It must not run scans, create scan log requests, change credentials, edit scan profiles, update integrations, post comments, open PRs/MRs, or mutate Endor state.
