# Remediation Planning

Previews safe remediation options for existing Endor findings without
changing code or opening a pull request. It compares VersionUpgrade and
Upgrade Impact Analysis candidates using findings fixed, upgrade risk,
compatibility evidence, and available data, then recommends the safest
evidence-backed next step.

## Start Here

This is the Claude Code generated agent for `remediation-planning`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Copy the generated subagent into `.claude/agents/` and restart Claude Code if needed. Then use the example prompt below: @agent-remediation-planning preview remediation options for this repository |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/remediation-planning/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `sonnet`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `host default`.
- Generated behavior: agent frontmatter defaults to sonnet.
- Override behavior: Claude environment or per-invocation subagent override wins.
- Provider guidance: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>.

## Install

Copy `remediation-planning.md` into your target repository's `.claude/agents/` directory,
then restart Claude Code if needed.

## Requirements

- Claude Code with the generated subagent file installed.
- Authenticated endorctl for the read-only API lookups documented in endorctl-setup.md.

## Example

```text
@agent-remediation-planning preview remediation options for this repository
```

## Architecture

![Remediation Planning architecture](architecture.svg)

This dry-run workflow resolves project or finding context, gathers Endor remediation evidence, and returns a plan only. It does not edit files, push branches, or open PRs/MRs.

## Notes

- This agent uses read-only `endorctl agent api --agent-id remediation-planning` lookups and does not require Endor MCP.
- Bash use is limited by prompt to the documented Endor lookup commands.
