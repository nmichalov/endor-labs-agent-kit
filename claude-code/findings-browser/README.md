# Findings Browser

Browses, filters, and summarizes existing Endor findings without starting
new scans or performing remediation. It shows the applied scope and filters,
relevant severity and reachability context, pagination or truncation limits,
and any evidence gaps affecting the results.

## Start Here

This is the Claude Code generated agent for `findings-browser`.

| Reader | First move |
| --- | --- |
| Human operator | Copy the generated subagent into `.claude/agents/` and restart Claude Code if needed. Then use the example prompt below: @agent-findings-browser help |
| Agent installer | Copy the generated files exactly, including the generated prompt or skill file, `endorctl-setup.md`, `architecture.svg`. Do not summarize or rewrite the generated prompt. |
| Maintainer | Change `source/agents/findings-browser/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, evals, action contracts, or `architecture.svg`, then regenerate the catalog. Do not hand-edit generated copies. |

## Recommended Model

This is a release-QA target, not a requirement or model allowlist.
Agent Kit does not block compatible customer-selected host models.

- Recommended model: `sonnet`.
- Selection mode: `pinned`.
- Recommended reasoning/effort: `host default`.
- Generated behavior: agent frontmatter defaults to sonnet.
- Override behavior: Claude environment or per-invocation subagent override wins.
- Provider guidance: <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents>.

## Install

Copy `findings-browser.md` into your target repository's `.claude/agents/` directory,
then restart Claude Code if needed.

## Requirements

- Claude Code with the generated subagent file installed.
- Authenticated endorctl for the read-only API lookups documented in endorctl-setup.md.

## Example

```text
@agent-findings-browser help
```

## Architecture

This diagram shows the generated agent contract, host responsibilities, and external systems required at runtime.

## Notes

- This agent uses read-only `endorctl agent api --agent-id findings-browser` lookups and does not require Endor MCP.
- Bash use is limited by prompt to the documented Endor lookup commands.
