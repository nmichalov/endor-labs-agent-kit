## 🚀 Plugin Quick Start

Current generated plugin package version: `2.1.0`.

| Host | Best for | First move |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Claude Code plugin agents, setup skill, and advisory hooks | Read `plugins/claude/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md`, then install `endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs`. |
| Codex | Skills plus optional bundled custom-agent TOML files | Read `plugins/codex/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md`. |
| Gemini CLI | Extension with skills and preview subagents | Read `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md`. |
| Antigravity CLI | Plugin with skills and subagents | Read `plugins/antigravity/endor-labs-agent-kit/README.md`. |
| Cursor IDE | Customer-facing Cursor plugin agents | Install from `.cursor-plugin/`, root `agents/`, root `skills/`, root `hooks/`, and `assets/logo.png`. |

Google documents Antigravity CLI as the consumer transition path for
Gemini CLI. Use the Gemini package for supported Gemini CLI environments
and compatibility checks; use the Antigravity package for affected Gemini
CLI consumer accounts.

After installing any host package, run setup first:

```text
Use the endor-agent-kit-setup skill to check Endor Agent Kit readiness. Do not run scans.
```

The plugin packages are the lowest-friction way to load Endor Labs
workflows into Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, or Cursor. They package setup
guidance and generated workflow agents/skills from the same source recipes
as the manual catalog without injecting every recipe into the active model
context.

Claude compatibility note: `ai-plugins@endorlabs` remains available for
existing Claude Code users and pinned installs. New users should prefer
`endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs`. Do not enable both Claude plugin ids in
one profile because they expose the same setup skill and agents. The
plugin does not auto-disable, uninstall, or edit Claude settings for
either id.

After installing a plugin, ask the host to use the `endor-agent-kit-setup`
skill first. Setup checks local readiness, guides `endorctl` authentication
and namespace selection, reports `gh` and toolchain gaps, and offers
host-specific self-checks before live Endor lookups.

## 🐍 Cursor SDK Quick Start

Use `cursor-sdk/` when you want to launch Cursor agents from Python code, CI, orchestration, or a backend service.
Use the Cursor plugin package when you want agents installed into the Cursor IDE.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r cursor-sdk/requirements.txt
export CURSOR_API_KEY="crsr_..."
python cursor-sdk/run_cursor_agent.py endor-probe-droid-agent \
  --workspace /path/to/repo \
  "Explain what evidence you need to assess GitHub onboarding gaps. Keep it read-only."
```

The SDK package includes `cursor-sdk/agent_definitions.json`, generated prompt files under `cursor-sdk/agents/`, and a runnable `run_cursor_agent.py` launcher for local or cloud agents.

The full catalog below still matters for manual installs, portable bundles,
and future agent contributions.

## 🔒 Boundaries And Rules

- Always preserve the generated recipe safety contract, approval gates, and evidence requirements.
- Always treat setup as readiness and configuration guidance; setup must not run scans or mutate repositories.
- Always report namespace, authentication, MCP, `endorctl`, `gh`, or toolchain gaps before live Endor work.
- Never print, persist, or copy secret values; report credential presence only by variable or key name.
- Never run `endorctl host-check` from setup or generated plugin guidance.
- Never claim a file edit, branch push, PR/MR, ticket, policy write, or approval unless the host or adapter returned evidence.

## 🤖 Agent Operating Rules

If you are an AI agent reading this repository:

1. Decide whether the user is installing, reviewing, editing, or publishing.
2. For installs, read the selected generated README and copy the generated artifact exactly. Keep sibling files such as `architecture.svg`, `actions.yaml`, and `endorctl-setup.md` with the artifact when present.
3. For behavior changes, edit `source/agents/<agent>/recipe.yaml`, `instructions.md`, optional `actions.yaml`, evals, or publication templates. Do not hand-edit generated customer-facing copies as the source of truth.
4. Regenerate with `endor-agent-kit publish source/agents/*/recipe.yaml --dest . --prune --include-plugins` when plugin packages are in scope.
5. Validate with tests, guardrails, provenance checks, generated-artifact drift checks, and the provider checks listed in `docs/plugin-release-checklist.md`.
6. Sync `ai-plugins` only after Agent Kit generation is clean; use `docs/distribution-sync.md` for the mirror boundary.

## 📇 Agent Catalog

Generated artifacts are checked in so users can copy or install agents without
running the builder. Maintainer source recipes live under `source/agents/` and are the
maintainer-facing source of truth.

If you are installing an agent, start with the generated host directories below.
You only need `source/agents/` when you are changing or contributing an agent.

## 🧱 Already Have Your Own Tech Stack Or Workflows Wired?

Use the `portable/<agent>/` bundles when your organization already has an
agent runtime, repository workflow, ticketing workflow, approval system,
credential controls, and audit pipeline. Portable bundles give you the
agent instructions and runtime contract without assuming Claude Code,
Claude Managed Agents, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Cursor, Cursor SDK, or any other host-specific package shape.

Each portable bundle includes:

- `agent.md`: the generated runtime-neutral agent instructions.
- `agent.manifest.json`: machine-readable transports, capabilities, actions, wrappers, and degradation behavior.
- `output-contract.md`: inputs, outputs, adapter contracts, and mechanical workflow gates when available.
- Optional `actions.yaml` portable adapter contracts plus `endorctl-setup.md` and `architecture.svg` support files.

The runtime integration model is deliberately split:

- Agent Kit defines the workflow, evidence requirements, safety contract, and structured output.
- Your runtime enforces authentication, authorization, logging, audit, adapter execution, and approval policy.
- Runtime adapters perform semantic actions such as `endor.query`, `source.change_request.create`, `approval.verify`, `endor.policy.write`, and `ticket.create`.
- The agent must not claim an action completed unless the runtime adapter returns evidence such as a PR/MR URL, ticket ID, policy UUID, branch, validation result, or explicit data gap.

Example adapter mappings:

| Portable action | Example runtime adapters |
| --- | --- |
| `endor.query` | Endor API proxy, `endorctl api`, approved Endor MCP adapter |
| `source.change_request.create` | GitHub pull request, GitLab merge request, Bitbucket pull request, internal change workflow |
| `ticket.create` | Jira issue, ServiceNow task, Linear issue, internal ticketing |
| `approval.verify` | AppSec approval service, source-provider approval API, internal risk-acceptance workflow |

Example runtime wrapper:

```text
System:
Load portable/<agent>/agent.md as the generated instruction source.
Expose only the adapters allowed by portable/<agent>/agent.manifest.json and your organization policy.
Pause for confirmation when an action declares confirmation_required=true.
Return adapter evidence or a structured data gap after every action.

User:
Use this agent to analyze repository <repo>. Prefer ticket creation over a source change request unless the plan is low risk and validation evidence is available.
```

For remediation workflows, let the agent find the right remediation path
first. At the mutation gate, your runtime can offer approved targets such
as plan-only output, source change request creation, ticket creation, or
both. Remediation workflows may declare `ticket.create` directly;
other portable bundles can still use `ticket.create` as a runtime wrapper
after final output. The agent only claims ticket creation when the runtime
performs it and returns ticket evidence.

Portable bundles are generated artifacts. Configure local adapters and
organization policy outside the bundle. If agent behavior needs to change,
edit the Source Recipe and regenerate the catalog.

## 🧭 Agent Policy Packs

Agent Policy Packs are customer-owned declarative YAML rules that agents
evaluate before recommendations and mutating workflow gates. Generated
`agent.md`, `SKILL.md`, and `actions.yaml` files stay generated; active
policy packs live in trusted runtime or protected workspace configuration.

Policy pack support files live under `policy-packs/`:

- `policy-pack.schema.json`: public schema for policy packs.
- `policy-pack.template.yaml`: blank starting point.
- `examples/was-traditional-java8.yaml`: WebSphere Application Server traditional Java 8 cap example.
- `examples/liberty-java-fixpack.yaml`: WebSphere Liberty Java 17/21 fix-pack gate example.

Use `endor-agent-kit validate-policy-pack <policy.yaml>` before enabling
a pack, and pass `--policy-pack <policy.yaml>` to supported workflow
validators before advancing mutation gates.

## 🔌 MCP Usage

MCP is not used by the mutating remediation workflows. AI SAST Triage, SCA
Remediation, Remediation Planner, Upgrade Impact Analysis, Probe Droid,
and the Codex skills use documented Endor API or `endorctl api` paths
instead.

MCP remains in the catalog only where the current public recipe still depends
on Endor package/vulnerability lookup tools that do not yet have an
`endorctl api` contract in this kit:

| Agent | MCP use | Non-MCP path in same artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependency Decision Helper | Package risk, vulnerability list, and vulnerability enrichment. | `endorctl api` for package scores, license, and similar-package signals. |
| Endor Labs Package Risk Summary | Package risk, vulnerability list, and vulnerability enrichment. | `endorctl api` for package scores, license, and similar-package signals. |
| Endor Labs Repository Dependency Reviewer | Per-dependency risk and vulnerability checks after local read-only manifest inspection. | No non-MCP path currently. |
| Endor Labs Vulnerability Explainer | Vulnerability detail lookup. | No non-MCP path currently. |

If MCP is unavailable, those agents must record the missing signal in
`data_gaps` rather than blocking install or fabricating evidence.

Portable bundles do not configure MCP servers. They declare transport
requirements in `agent.manifest.json`. If a portable agent requires MCP,
the customer runtime must provide an MCP-compatible Endor adapter exposing
the required tools; otherwise the agent records the missing signal in
`data_gaps`.

## 📦 Plugin Packaging Route

Claude Code and Codex still publish generated artifacts under
`claude-code/<agent>/` and `codex/<agent>/` for manual installs.
Plugin package generation is available as an opt-in publication slice:

```bash
endor-agent-kit publish source/agents/*/recipe.yaml --dest . --prune --include-plugins
```

Generated plugin packages currently include:

- `plugins/codex/endor-labs-agent-kit/`: Codex plugin skills, bundled
  custom-agent TOML files, setup skill, installer script, and Codex
  marketplace metadata under `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and
  `plugins/codex/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
- `plugins/claude/endor-labs-agent-kit/`: Claude Code plugin agents, setup
  skill, and Claude marketplace metadata under `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  plus `plugins/claude/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for package-local testing.
- `plugins/claude/ai-plugins/`: legacy Claude Code compatibility package
  for existing `ai-plugins@endorlabs` installs. New installs should prefer
  `endor-labs-agent-kit@endorlabs`; do not enable both ids in one Claude profile.
- `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/`: Gemini CLI extension with setup
  skill, Gemini workflow skills, preview subagents, minimal context, and no
  zip release artifact.
- `plugins/antigravity/endor-labs-agent-kit/`: Antigravity CLI plugin with
  setup skill, Antigravity workflow skills, subagents, minimal assets, and
  a root `plugin.json`.
- `.cursor-plugin/` plus root `agents/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`, and `assets/logo.png`: Cursor plugin metadata,
  generated Cursor workflow agents, setup agent, support skills, and advisory hooks. Cursor
  does not install Gemini CLI extension files; use
  `plugins/gemini/endor-labs-agent-kit/` for Gemini.
- Root `.mcp.json` and `GEMINI.md`: optional MCP support context for the
  multi-host repo root. The root must not contain `gemini-extension.json`.
- `cursor-sdk/`: Cursor Python SDK automation package with generated prompt
  files, `agent_definitions.json`, `requirements.txt`, and a runnable
  `run_cursor_agent.py` launcher for local or cloud SDK agents.

All plugin packages preserve the same recipe source, action metadata, and
approval gates as the manual generated catalog. Cursor package files stay
at the repository root because the public Cursor package source is `./`.
Gemini installs from the
generated extension directory for local validation or from the tagged
GitHub repository for public distribution. Antigravity installs from the
generated plugin directory. No zip artifact is generated for these packages.
See `docs/plugin-packaging-design.md` for blast-radius notes.

## ✅ Release Checklist

Use `docs/plugin-release-checklist.md` before tagging or publishing plugin
packages. It records the provider-specific publish paths, local validation
commands, public GitHub distribution steps, and external documentation
freshness checks for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Antigravity, Cursor, Cursor SDK,
and Endor API/docs context.

## Editions

Most users should not need to think about editions. The current catalog
publishes one customer-facing artifact per agent and host, directly under
`claude-code/<agent>/`, `claude-managed-agents/<agent>/`, `codex/<agent>/`,
`gemini/<agent>/`, `cursor-sdk/agents/<agent>.md`, or `portable/<agent>/`.

The builder still understands internal `developer-edition` and
`enterprise-edition` recipe sections for compatibility and for future
agents that genuinely need multiple artifacts. When a recipe selects one
artifact, the published directory is flat and the generated README omits the
edition label.

Shell access is still controlled by each recipe's host capability contract.
Read-only agents that do not need `endorctl api` deny Bash. Read-only agents
that need `endorctl api` allow Bash only for documented read-only Endor
lookup commands. Mutating agents keep file edits, branch pushes, PR/MR
creation, comments, approval verification, and Endor policy writes behind
separate approval gates.

## Install An Agent

For Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or Antigravity CLI, prefer the plugin package README
when you want the full generated workflow set and setup guidance. For Cursor, use
the `.cursor-plugin/` metadata, root `agents/`, root `skills/`, root `hooks/`, and `assets/logo.png`. For a single
agent, pick an agent from the catalog, then open that host directory's
README. If the agent has edition subdirectories, choose the one that
matches your environment; otherwise use the agent directory directly. For
scripted Cursor automation, use `cursor-sdk/README.md` instead of the
Cursor IDE plugin metadata.

### Ask An LLM To Install It

If you are using an assistant that can edit files or run commands in your
target repository, copy and paste this prompt:

```text
Install this Endor Labs Agent Kit agent in the current repository.

Agent Kit root: /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit
Host: claude-code
Agent directory: claude-code/ai-sast-triage

Please:
1. Read the install README at <Agent Kit root>/<Agent directory>/README.md.
2. Install the generated agent artifact from that directory into this repository.
3. Preserve the generated agent prompt exactly; do not rewrite or summarize it.
4. Tell me any Endor MCP if declared, endorctl, repository, or credential setup still required.
5. Show me the command or prompt I should use to invoke the agent.
```

Replace `Agent directory` with the directory you selected from the catalog.

### Claude Code

Copy the generated subagent into your target repository and restart Claude
Code if needed.

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cp /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/claude-code/ai-sast-triage/ai-sast-triage.md \
  .claude/agents/ai-sast-triage.md
```

Then invoke it from Claude Code:

```text
@agent-ai-sast-triage triage AI SAST findings for this repository
```

### Claude Managed Agents

Create the agent and environment with the Anthropic CLI or Console. If the
selected agent declares MCP in its generated `README.md`, update the MCP
server URL and vault references in the generated YAML first.

```bash
cd /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/claude-managed-agents/dependency-decision-helper
ant beta:agents create < agent.yaml
ant beta:environments create < environment.yaml
```

Use `session-template.yaml` as the starting point when creating sessions.

### Codex

Copy the generated skill directory into your Codex skills directory, then
start a new Codex session so the skill loader can see it.

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/ai-sast-triage \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/ai-sast-triage"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/cicd-posture \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/cicd-posture"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/dependency-decision-helper \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/dependency-decision-helper"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/package-risk-summary \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/package-risk-summary"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/repository-dependency-reviewer \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/repository-dependency-reviewer"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/upgrade-impact-analysis \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/upgrade-impact-analysis"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/vulnerability-explainer \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/vulnerability-explainer"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/endor-troubleshooter \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/endor-troubleshooter"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/findings-browser \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/findings-browser"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/malware-response \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/malware-response"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/probe-droid \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/probe-droid"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/remediation-planner \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/remediation-planner"
cp -R /path/to/endor-labs-agent-kit/codex/sca-remediation \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/sca-remediation"
```

Then invoke it from Codex:

```text
Use the ai-sast-triage skill to triage AI SAST findings for this repository.
Use the cicd-posture skill to assess CI/CD and supply chain posture for namespace <namespace>.
Use the dependency-decision-helper skill to help with this Endor Labs workflow.
Use the package-risk-summary skill to help with this Endor Labs workflow.
Use the repository-dependency-reviewer skill to help with this Endor Labs workflow.
Use the upgrade-impact-analysis skill to help with this Endor Labs workflow.
Use the vulnerability-explainer skill to help with this Endor Labs workflow.
Use the endor-troubleshooter skill to diagnose this Endor issue from redacted error text and read-only tenant evidence.
Use the findings-browser skill to show the critical and high reachable findings for namespace <namespace>.
Use the malware-response skill to help with this Endor Labs workflow.
Use the probe-droid skill to probe GitHub org <org> for Endor monitored-branch onboarding gaps and setup prescriptions.
Use the remediation-planner skill to help with this Endor Labs workflow.
Use the sca-remediation skill to check this repository for P0 SCA findings I can start remediating.
```

### Cursor SDK

Run generated Cursor SDK agents from Python against a local workspace or
Cursor cloud repo:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r cursor-sdk/requirements.txt
export CURSOR_API_KEY="crsr_..."
python cursor-sdk/run_cursor_agent.py endor-probe-droid-agent --workspace /path/to/repo \
  "Explain what evidence you need to assess GitHub onboarding gaps. Keep it read-only."
```

For cloud agents, pass `--mode cloud --repo-url <repo-url> --ref <branch>`.

## Configure Endor Access

| Access path | Used by | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Endor MCP | Agents whose generated artifact declares an MCP server | Configure it through the target host's MCP mechanism only when the selected agent requires it. |
| `endorctl api` or direct Endor API | Agents that need tenant, project, finding, or policy data without MCP | The generated prompts constrain commands to documented lookups and writes. Agent or edition README files link to `endorctl-setup.md` when needed. |
| GitHub read-only inventory credentials | Probe Droid | Required when the agent compares GitHub.com repository inventory with Endor projects without cloning or mutating repositories. |
| Git and source-provider credentials | Mutating Claude Code agents such as AI SAST Triage and SCA Remediation | Required when the agent is expected to apply patches, open change requests, read PR/MR approval evidence, or post PR/MR comments. |
| Codex terminal and file-editing tools | Codex skills for mutating agents such as AI SAST Triage and SCA Remediation | The skill keeps file edits, branch pushes, PR/MR creation, PR/MR comments, and Endor policy writes behind separate approval gates. |
| Cursor SDK API key | Cursor SDK automation package | Required for local or cloud SDK runs. Use `CURSOR_API_KEY`; do not paste the key into prompts. |
| Endor policy-write access | AI SAST Triage standalone exceptions | Required only when a verified AppSec PR/MR approval should create a scoped Endor exception policy. The agent must show the policy spec and ask for confirmation before writing. |

```

## 🧪 Output Contract

Agents return concise prose plus a JSON block. The exact schema depends on the
agent. If a signal is unavailable because of setup, authentication, account
tier, or tooling, agents record that in `data_gaps` instead of inventing
evidence.

SCA remediation outputs can be checked mechanically before a workflow advances:

```bash
endor-agent-kit validate-sca-output sca-output.json --gate selection-plan
endor-agent-kit render-sca-pr-body sca-output.json > pr-body.md
endor-agent-kit lint-sca-pr-body pr-body.md
endor-agent-kit check-install --agent sca-remediation --repo /path/to/repo
endor-agent-kit check-install --host claude-managed-agents --agent probe-droid
endor-agent-kit check-install --host codex --agent sca-remediation --skills-home ~/.agents/skills
endor-agent-kit check-install --host portable --agent sca-remediation --portable-dir /path/to/runtime/agents/sca-remediation
endor-agent-kit validate-ai-sast-output ai-sast-output.json --gate remediation
endor-agent-kit render-ai-sast-pr-body ai-sast-output.json > pr-body.md
endor-agent-kit lint-ai-sast-pr-body pr-body.md
endor-agent-kit render-ai-sast-approval-comment ai-sast-output.json > approval-comment.md
endor-agent-kit lint-ai-sast-approval-comment approval-comment.md
endor-agent-kit render-ai-sast-exception-policy-comment ai-sast-output.json > policy-comment.md
endor-agent-kit lint-ai-sast-exception-policy-comment policy-comment.md
```

`validate-sca-output` rejects Selection / Plan responses that omit
`risk_decision.status`, use nonstandard branch names, or try to advance a
CIA-indeterminate upgrade without source-usage evidence and validation
requirements. `render-sca-pr-body` turns normalized advisory data into the
AURI-style PR/MR body, including the folded advisory list, CVE-visible links
to GHSA URLs, and severity emoji suffixes.
`check-install` catches copied Claude Code primary artifacts, staged
Claude Managed Agents bundles, and installed Codex skill bundles that are
stale versus the checked-in Agent Kit catalog. It can also compare a copied
portable bundle with the catalog when you pass `--host portable` and
`--portable-dir`.

AI SAST triage outputs can be checked before remediation, PR/MR, or
exception-policy gates advance. `validate-ai-sast-output` requires
project and namespace provenance, finding/source-location provenance,
approval evidence before exception policies, and a rendered PR/MR body
when a remediation change request is part of the plan. For exception
policies it also checks accepted-risk expiration, approval reason
matching, approved finding scope, project selector scope, policy names,
idempotency checks, and human-readable decision comments. The AI SAST
PR/MR renderer follows the AURI AI SAST remediation structure with
`auri:ai-sast-context` metadata, severity indicator emojis, sanitized
AURI evidence, a standalone exception-request prompt block, folded finding details,
and standalone Agent Kit policy-write gates that still require independent
AppSec approval before any Endor policy write. Standalone Agent Kit is not
a webhook listener: PR/MR comments are approval evidence, and a user or
external automation must invoke the installed agent before any policy can
be created or reused.

For `sca-remediation`, keep the three remediation lanes distinct:

- P0/exploited remediation candidates: rank reachable or exploited critical/high findings and require UIA evidence before naming a best fix.
- Other non-breaking low-risk UIA-backed PRs: list only low-risk, CIA-clean recommendations with zero introduced findings and enough repo metadata to open a PR/MR.
- Risky or indeterminate upgrades: use `risk_decision` from Endor evidence plus local source usage before applying or opening a change request.

The low-risk lane reports `low_risk_recommendations`, `candidate_prs`,
`ready_to_open`, `most_findings_in_one_pr`, and `p0_duplicates_hidden`.
Validation commands must come from the repository's actual manifest and
package-manager layout; the agent must not assume Java, Maven, npm, Python,
Go, .NET, Ruby, Rust, or any other ecosystem from prior runs.

## 🛡️ Safety Model

Most agents in this kit are read-only. Recipes declare their safety class and
host capabilities explicitly.

Read-only agents do not:

- edit files
- create pull requests
- run scans
- dismiss findings
- create policies
- mutate Endor Labs state

Mutating agents are published only when their recipe declares the required
host capabilities. AI SAST Triage and SCA Remediation may fetch source
context, write patch files, run git/source-provider commands, and open a
change request when the user asks for that workflow and the target repository
credentials are available.

When a read-only agent permits Bash, its prompt limits Bash to documented
read-only Endor lookup commands. Claude Code artifacts deny Bash when it is
not needed.

When a recipe declares `host_capabilities_required.read_files: true`,
Claude Code artifacts allow only `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, and `LS` for
read-only workspace inspection; file mutation, notebook, web, and todo tools
remain denied.
Claude Managed Agents artifacts omit the pre-built agent toolset unless an
agent needs read-only Bash, and then enable only Bash with confirmation.

## Guardrail And Runtime Security Docs

The repository includes two maintainer-facing guardrail references:

- `docs/guardrails.md` maps recipe, host, portable, workflow, and artifact-integrity controls to the current catalog.
- `docs/portable-runtime-conformance.md` defines the runtime controls a customer-managed portable integration must enforce around adapters, approvals, evidence, audit, untrusted content, and failure modes.

## Contribute An Agent

This repository is the source of truth for agent behavior and generated
package output. The public `endorlabs/ai-plugins` repository is the
distribution mirror. New agents, skills, hooks, action contracts, and
publication changes start here, not in `ai-plugins`.

Read `docs/contributing-agents.md` for the official proposal, review,
approval, provenance, signing, and generated `ai-plugins` PR process.

### Create Agents With The Skill

Use the Create Endor Labs Agent skill to make your own Endor Labs agent.
The skill lives at `skills/create-endor-labs-agent/SKILL.md` and guides an
assistant through agent design, recipe authoring, prompt sections, evals,
architecture diagrams, tests, catalog regeneration, and validation.

The skill supports two public input styles: a net-new agent brief or a
generic sanitized agent blueprint. Private tools may generate a blueprint,
but Agent Kit should only receive customer-safe recipe, action, instruction,
eval, and architecture source files.

For Claude Code, install it at either the repository or user level:

```bash
# Repository-level install
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -R skills/create-endor-labs-agent .claude/skills/

# User-level install
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -R skills/create-endor-labs-agent ~/.claude/skills/
```

Then ask your assistant:

```text
Use the create Endor Labs agent skill to make an agent that <does the workflow you want>.
```

You can also point any agent directly at
`skills/create-endor-labs-agent/SKILL.md` if it does not support native
skills.

### Development Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Authoring Workflow

1. Edit `source/agents/<agent>/recipe.yaml`.
2. Edit `source/agents/<agent>/instructions.md`.
3. Update `source/agents/<agent>/evals/cases.yaml`.
4. Add `source/agents/<agent>/architecture.svg` in the existing diagram format.
5. Add or update tests under `tests/`.
6. Validate and regenerate the catalog.

```bash
endor-agent-kit validate source/agents/<agent>/recipe.yaml
endor-agent-kit doctor-new-agent source/agents/<agent>/recipe.yaml
endor-agent-kit authoring-check source/agents/<agent>/recipe.yaml --new-agent
endor-agent-kit publish source/agents/*/recipe.yaml --dest . --prune --include-plugins
endor-agent-kit check-guardrails --catalog-root .
endor-agent-kit verify-provenance --catalog-root .
endor-agent-kit verify-endor-context --upstream
python -m pytest -q
git diff --exit-code -- README.md manifest.json .agents/plugins .claude-plugin .cursor-plugin agents assets claude-code claude-managed-agents codex cursor-sdk gemini hooks plugins portable skills
```

Pull requests should include both source changes and regenerated artifacts.
CI runs validation, generated-artifact drift checks, guardrails, and
provenance verification. After a maintainer merges to `main`,
`.github/workflows/publish-ai-plugins-pr.yml` opens or updates the
generated `ai-plugins` distribution PR.

## 📖 Reference

### Recipe Reference

Recipes are YAML files with schema version `1` or `2`. They describe the agent's
prompt, Endor access paths, host capabilities, inputs, outputs, evals, and
published host editions. Schema v2 recipes may also point to `actions.yaml`
for semantic side-effect contracts such as opening change requests or
requesting exception-policy approval.

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `id`, `name`, `version`, `description` | Public catalog identity and copy. |
| `safety_class`, `mutations` | Safety contract. Recipes may be `read_only`, `dry_run`, or explicitly `mutating` with matching host capabilities. |
| `supported_transports` | Endor access paths such as `mcp` and `endorctl_api`. |
| `host_capabilities_required` | Abstract host capabilities that compilers map to host-specific tools. |
| `action_contracts_path` | Optional schema v2 path to `actions.yaml`, which declares semantic side effects and adapter requirements. |
| `policy_pack_support` | Enables Agent Policy Pack instructions, structured policy outputs, and portable runtime policy-evaluation capability. |
| `inputs`, `outputs` | User-facing IO contract and expected JSON output shape. |
| `compatible_hosts` | Hosts that should receive generated artifacts. |
| `host_editions` | Optional host-specific edition selection. Omit to publish all default editions for that host. |
| `required_endor_mcp_tools`, `endorctl_api_invocations` | Endor tools and API lookup groups the prompt may use. |
| `instructions_path`, `evals` | Source prompt and eval case files relative to the recipe. |
| `architecture.svg` | Required source diagram copied into generated catalog artifacts when present. |

Generated artifacts must not be edited as the first step. Change the recipe
or instructions source, publish the catalog, then review the generated diff.
